# Kafka Core Concepts

## Kafka Architecture Overview

Kafka operates as a distributed messaging system that follows a client-server architecture. Applications connect to Kafka brokers via configuration settings:

```python
bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092'
```
**This setting establishes the fundamental connection between client applications and the Kafka cluster, serving as the entry point for all communications. The cluster maintains topics that organize message streams, while clients interact with these topics through well-defined APIs.**


The Kafka broker handles message persistence, replication, and delivery, functioning as an intermediary between producers and consumers while maintaining highly available service.

### Producer-Consumer Model

The implementation demonstrates Kafka's producer-consumer model through specialized components:

**Producers**
Producers are applications that publish messages to specific topics. The code shows multiple producer implementations:

- `A video frame producer that extracts and sends face detection data`
- `A media stream producer that publishes encoded audio and video chunks`
- `A messaging producer that sends chat data`
```python
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)
producer.send(topic, result)
```

**Consumers**
Consumers subscribe to topics and process published messages. Different consumer implementations demonstrate varying consumption patterns:

- `A face data consumer that processes detection results and stores them in a database`
- `A video consumer that reconstructs frames from received data`
- `A threaded consumer within a web application that maintains an in-memory queue`

```python
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'Faces',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)

for msg in consumer:
    data = msg.value
    # Process the message
```
This decoupled architecture enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of producers and consumers.

## Topics and Partitions

This decoupled architecture enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of producers and consumers.

```python
# Different topics for different data domains
'Faces'        # Face detection data
'chat'         # Messaging data
'media-stream' # Video and audio streaming data
```
Topics are physically implemented as partitions, providing the foundation for parallelism and distributed processing. While partitioning configuration is not explicitly shown in the code, the Kafka client libraries manage the distribution of messages across partitions when multiple partitions exist.


Messages with the same key are guaranteed to be sent to the same partition, enabling ordering guarantees for related messages.

## Message Delivery Semantics

The implementation demonstrates various delivery semantics through configuration options:

```python
# Different offset reset strategies
auto_offset_reset='earliest'  # Process all available messages
auto_offset_reset='latest'    # Process only new messages
```

```python
# Ensuring message delivery
producer.flush()  # Blocks until messages are sent
```
```python
# Managing consumer offsets
enable_auto_commit=True  # Automatically track processed messages
```
These settings control the reliability guarantees:
- At-most-once: When producers don't wait for acknowledgments
- At-least-once: When producers confirm delivery and consumers track offsets
- Exactly-once: Requires additional configuration using transactions and idempotent producers

The implementation primarily uses at-least-once semantics, ensuring messages are never lost while accepting the possibility of duplicate processing.

## Getting Started
This section guides you through the practical steps to begin using Kafka in your application.

## Basic Setup

Before creating producers and consumers, you need to set up a basic Kafka environment:

```python
# Import the required libraries
from kafka import KafkaProducer, KafkaConsumer
import json

# Define broker connection information
KAFKA_BROKER = 'localhost:9092'
TOPIC_NAME = 'example-topic'
```
Make sure your Kafka broker is running and accessible at the specified address before proceeding to the next steps.

## Simple Producer Example
The following example demonstrates how to create a basic producer that sends messages to a Kafka topic:

```python
# Create a Kafka producer with JSON serialization
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers=KAFKA_BROKER,
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8')
)

# Send a message to the topic
message = {"key": "value", "timestamp": "2023-04-09T12:00:00Z"}
producer.send(TOPIC_NAME, message)

# Ensure the message is sent before continuing
producer.flush()

print("Message sent successfully!")
```
This producer serializes Python dictionaries to JSON before sending them to the Kafka topic.

## Simple Consumer Example
Here's how to create a basic consumer that reads messages from a Kafka topic:

```python
# Create a Kafka consumer with JSON deserialization
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    TOPIC_NAME,
    bootstrap_servers=KAFKA_BROKER,
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)

# Process messages
print("Waiting for messages...")
for message in consumer:
    data = message.value
    print(f"Received: {data}")
    
    # Process the message data here
    
    # To exit the loop (in this example), break after processing one message
    break

consumer.close()
```
This consumer deserializes JSON messages back into Python dictionaries and processes them one by one.

## Configuration Options
Kafka clients offer numerous configuration options to customize behavior:

```python
producer = KafkaProducer(
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'),
    acks='all',                # Wait for all replicas to acknowledge
    retries=3,                 # Number of retries if the broker is unavailable
    batch_size=16384,          # Size of batches in bytes
    linger_ms=10,              # Delay in milliseconds to allow batching
    compression_type='gzip',   # Message compression type
    max_in_flight_requests_per_connection=1  # For strict ordering
)
```
**Consumer Configuration**
```python
consumer = KafkaConsumer(
    'example-topic',
    bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
    group_id='my-group',          # Consumer group ID
    auto_offset_reset='earliest',  # Start from beginning of topic
    enable_auto_commit=True,      # Automatically commit offsets
    auto_commit_interval_ms=5000, # Commit interval in milliseconds
    fetch_max_bytes=52428800,     # Max bytes to fetch per request
    max_poll_records=500,         # Max records per poll
    value_deserializer=lambda v: json.loads(v.decode('utf-8'))
)
```
These configurations allow you to fine-tune performance, reliability, and behavior of your Kafka applications.
